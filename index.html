                    <span>A Journey from Despair to Hope</span>
                    <p>"When my family and I fled our home, we had nothing but the clothes on our backs and a desperate <br>
                        hope for survival. The Support Refugees Initiative welcomed us with open arms. They provided us with <br>
                        food, medical care, and a safe place to stay. But more than that, they gave us hope.<br>
                        Through their vocational training programs, I was able to learn new skills and secure a job<br>
                        Today, I’m not just surviving; I’m thriving. My children are in school, and our future looks brighter than ever<br>
                       SRI has truly transformed our lives, and for that, I am forever grateful" .</p>

                    <span>Rebuilding Lives, One Step at a Time</span>
                    <p>"Escaping the violence in our home country was only the beginning of our challenges. We arrived at the <br>
                    refugee camp with no idea of what the future held. Thanks to SRI, my family received not only the <br>
                    basics like food and clothing but also the emotional and psychological support we so desperately<br>
                    needed. Their counseling services helped us heal and regain our strength. With their assistance, my <br>
                    husband found work, and I started a small business through their microfinance program. Today, we are <br>
                    rebuilding our lives, and I can’t express how much SRI has done for us."</p>

                    <p>"I will never forget the day I arrived at the refugee camp, scared and unsure of what the future would <br>
                    bring. The Support Refugees Initiative was there for me from the start. They provided me with the <br>
                   medical care I needed and, over time, involved me in their sensitization programs. Through these <br>
                   programs, I learned about my rights and how to advocate for myself and others. With the confidence I <br>
                    gained, I started volunteering with SRI, helping others in my community. Today, I’m proud to say that <br>
                    I’ve become a leader in our refugee community, working alongside SRI to support others in their<br>
                   journeys." </p>
